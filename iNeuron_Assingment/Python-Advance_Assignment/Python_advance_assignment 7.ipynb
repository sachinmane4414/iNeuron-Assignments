    "### Q1. What is the purpose of the try statement?\n",
    "The `try` statement in Python is used for exception handling. It allows us to specify a block of code to be executed, and if an exception occurs during the execution, the code can gracefully handle the exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of the `try` statement in action:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    # some code that might raise an exception\n",
    "    x = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n",
    "    y = 100 / x\n",
    "except ValueError:\n",
    "    print(\"Invalid input. You must enter an integer.\")\n",
    "except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "    print(\"You cannot divide by zero.\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    # this code will only execute if no exception occurs\n",
    "    print(f\"The result is {y}.\")\n",
    "finally:\n",
    "    # this code will execute regardless of whether an exception occurred or not\n",
    "    print(\"Execution complete.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `try` block contains code that may raise an exception, such as a `ValueError` if the user enters a non-integer input or a `ZeroDivisionError` if the user enters zero. The `except` blocks are used to catch specific types of exceptions and handle them appropriately. The `else` block is optional and will only execute if no exception occurs. The `finally` block is also optional and will execute regardless of whether an exception occurred or not."

    "### Q2. What are the two most popular try statement variations?\n",
    "The two most popular try statement variations in Python are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. try-except: This version is used to catch and handle exceptions that occur in a block of code. The syntax is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    # block of code where exception might occur\n",
    "except <ExceptionType>:\n",
    "    # code to handle the exception\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, `<ExceptionType>` is the type of exception you want to catch. If an exception of this type occurs in the `try` block, control is transferred to the `except` block. You can have multiple `except` blocks to handle different types of exceptions, or use a catch-all `except` block to handle any type of exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    num = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n",
    "    result = 10 / num\n",
    "except ValueError:\n",
    "    print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a valid integer.\")\n",
    "except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "    print(\"Cannot divide by zero.\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"Result:\", result)\n",
    "finally:\n",
    "    print(\"Done!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. try-finally: This version is used to ensure that certain code is executed, regardless of whether or not an exception occurs. The syntax is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    # block of code where exception might occur\n",
    "finally:\n",
    "    # code to be executed regardless of exception status\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the `finally` block is guaranteed to be executed, even if an exception occurs in the `try` block. This is useful for releasing resources that need to be cleaned up, or for ensuring that certain tasks are always completed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    f = open(\"myfile.txt\", \"r\")\n",
    "    # perform some file operations\n",
    "finally:\n",
    "    f.close()\n",
    "    print(\"File closed.\")\n",

    "### Q3. What is the purpose of the raise statement?\n",
    "The `raise` statement is used to raise an exception explicitly in Python. It is generally used when we want to handle the exception in our own way instead of allowing Python to handle it in its default way. The syntax of the `raise` statement is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "raise [exceptionName [(reason)]]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, `exceptionName` is the name of the exception that we want to raise, and `reason` is an optional message that describes the reason for raising the exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def divide(a, b):\n",
    "    if b == 0:\n",
    "        raise ZeroDivisionError(\"Division by zero not allowed\")\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        return a/b\n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    result = divide(10, 0)\n",
    "    print(result)\n",
    "except ZeroDivisionError as error:\n",
    "    print(\"Exception caught:\", error)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "Exception caught: Division by zero not allowed\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above example, we have defined a `divide()` function that raises a `ZeroDivisionError` exception if the second argument `b` is zero. In the `try` block, we have called the `divide()` function with `10` and `0` as arguments. Since the second argument is `0`, the `ZeroDivisionError` exception is raised explicitly using the `raise` statement. The exception is caught in the `except` block, and the error message is printed to the console."

    "### Q4. What does the assert statement do, and what other statement is it like?\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the `assert` statement is used as a debugging aid to check for conditions that must be true. If the condition is not true, then the `assert` statement raises an `AssertionError` exception with an optional error message.\n",
    "\n",
    "The syntax of the `assert` statement is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "assert condition, error_message\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, `condition` is an expression that must evaluate to `True` or `False`, and `error_message` is an optional string that will be displayed if the assertion fails.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's say we are writing a function that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the sum of those numbers. We can use the `assert` statement to check that the input is indeed a list of numbers:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def sum_numbers(numbers):\n",
    "    assert isinstance(numbers, list), \"Input must be a list\"\n",
    "    return sum(numbers)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `assert` statement checks that `numbers` is a list. If it is not, then an `AssertionError` will be raised with the error message \"Input must be a list\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The `assert` statement is similar to the `if` statement, but with one key difference: if the condition is not true, then the `assert` statement raises an exception and halts program execution. This makes it a useful tool for catching errors during development and testing.\n"

    "### Q5. What is the purpose of the with/as argument, and what other statement is it like?\n",
    "The `with/as` statement in Python is used to define a block of code to be executed in the context of a context manager. It simplifies the management of resources, such as opening and closing files, by encapsulating the setup and tear-down logic. It is similar to the `try/finally` statement, but with more concise syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic syntax of the `with/as` statement is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with context_manager as variable:\n",
    "    # block of code\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, `context_manager` is an object that supports the context management protocol, and `variable` is a variable to which the context manager will be assigned. The context manager is responsible for defining the setup and tear-down logic that will be executed before and after the block of code, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's say we have a file named `example.txt` that we want to open and read. We can use the `with/as` statement to automatically close the file when we're done:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with open('example.txt', 'r') as f:\n",
    "    contents = f.read()\n",
    "    \n",
    "# Do something with the contents of the file\n",
    "print(contents)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `open()` function returns a context manager that is responsible for opening the file and returning a file object. The `with/as` statement assigns the file object to the variable `f`. The block of code reads the contents of the file into the variable `contents`. Once the block of code completes, the context manager automatically closes the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is equivalent to using a `try/finally` statement to ensure that the file is closed:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "f = open('example.txt', 'r')\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    contents = f.read()\n",
    "finally:\n",
    "    f.close()\n",
    "    \n",
    "# Do something with the contents of the file\n",
    "print(contents)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, the `with/as` statement provides a more concise and readable way to manage resources in Python."

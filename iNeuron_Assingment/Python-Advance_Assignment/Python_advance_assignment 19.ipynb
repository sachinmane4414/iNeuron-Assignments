    "### Q1. Define the relationship between a class and its instances. Is it a one-to-one or a one-to-many partnership, for example\n",
    "\n",
    "In object-oriented programming, a class is a blueprint for creating objects, while an instance is a single, unique unit of a class. The relationship between a class and its instances is one-to-many, where a class can have many instances. Each instance of a class has its own unique set of attributes and can have different values for those attributes. The class defines the attributes and methods that each instance will have, while instances are created based on the class template.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider a class named `Person` that represents a person with attributes such as `name`, `age`, and `gender`, and methods such as `speak()` and `walk()`. We can create multiple instances of the `Person` class, each with its own set of attributes and values, such as:\n",

    "### Q2. What kind of data is held only in an instance?\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, instance variables hold data that is unique to each instance of a class. This means that each instance can have different values for its instance variables. Instance variables are defined within the constructor method of a class, which is called `__init__()` in Python. The instance variables can be accessed using the dot notation `.` followed by the variable name, using the instance as the object. \n",

    "car2 = Car('Honda', 'Civic', 2021)\n",

    "print(car1.make)   # Output: Toyota\n",
    "print(car2.make)   # Output: Honda\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, `make`, `model`, and `year` are instance variables that are unique to each instance of the `Car` class. Each instance can have different values for these variables. When we create `car1` and `car2` objects, we pass different arguments to the `__init__()` method to set the instance variables for each object. Finally, we can access the instance variables using the dot notation with the instance name."

    "In Python, a class is a blueprint for creating objects, and it defines a set of attributes and methods that all objects created from that class will have. A class defines the behavior of its instances and describes their attributes and methods. The attributes are the data that belongs to the object, while the methods are the operations that can be performed on the object's data. Therefore, a class holds the knowledge of how to create instances with a specific set of attributes and methods, whereas instances hold the specific data for those attributes. Here's an example:\n",

    "\n",
    "In Python, a method is a function defined inside a class that operates on the instance of the class. The method is called on an instance of the class, and it can access and modify the instance's data attributes. The primary difference between a method and a regular function is that the method is bound to the instance of the class and has access to its attributes, whereas the function has no such access. \n",

    "### Q5. Is inheritance supported in Python, and if so, what is the syntax?\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, inheritance is supported in Python. Inheritance is the process by which a new class is created, which inherits the attributes and methods of an existing class. The new class is called the subclass or derived class, and the existing class is called the superclass or base class.\n",
    "\n",

    "In Python, encapsulation is supported to some extent through name mangling. By prefixing an instance or class variable with double underscores (`__`), the variable is made private, which means that it cannot be accessed or modified directly from outside the class. However, the variable can still be accessed and modified through its mangled name, which is the original name of the variable with the class name prefixed with a single underscore. This means that encapsulation is not as strict in Python as it is in some other object-oriented languages. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class MyClass:\n",
    "    def __init__(self):\n",
    "        self.__private_var = 42\n",
    "        \n",

    "print(my_obj._MyClass__private_var)  # prints 23\n",
    "``` \n",
    "\n",
    "In the example, the `__private_var` variable is made private by prefixing it with double underscores. It can be accessed and modified through the `get_private_var()` and `set_private_var()` methods, but not directly from outside the class. However, the variable can still be accessed through its mangled name, which is `_MyClass__private_var`. This means that the encapsulation is not completely strict in Python."

    "        self.make = make\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, `self` is used in the `__init__`, `get_make`, and `set_make` methods to refer to the instance of the `Car` class that is calling the method. The `__init__` method uses `self` to set the instance variables `make`, `model`, and `year`. The `get_make` method uses `self` to return the value of the `make` instance variable. The `set_make` method uses `self` to set the value of the `make` instance variable.\n",

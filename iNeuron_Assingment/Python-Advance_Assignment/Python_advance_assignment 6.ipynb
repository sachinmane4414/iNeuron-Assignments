    "### Q1. Describe three applications for exception processing.\n",
    "Exception handling is a programming technique used to handle and manage errors that may occur during program execution. Here are three applications of exception processing in Python along with examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Error Handling: One of the primary applications of exception processing is to handle errors that may occur during program execution. For example, if you're trying to open a file that doesn't exist, a `FileNotFoundError` exception will be raised. You can use a `try` and `except` block to catch the exception and handle the error gracefully:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    file = open(\"nonexistent_file.txt\")\n",
    "except FileNotFoundError:\n",
    "    print(\"The specified file does not exist.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Input Validation: Exception processing can also be used for input validation. For example, if you're expecting the user to enter an integer value, you can catch the `ValueError` exception that may be raised if the user enters a non-integer value:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "while True:\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        age = int(input(\"Enter your age: \"))\n",
    "        break\n",
    "    except ValueError:\n",
    "        print(\"Invalid input! Please enter an integer value.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Resource Cleanup: Exceptions can also be used to ensure that resources are cleaned up properly. For example, if you're working with a file, you can use a `try` and `finally` block to ensure that the file is closed even if an exception occurs:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    file = open(\"myfile.txt\")\n",
    "    # Do something with the file\n",
    "finally:\n",
    "    file.close()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In all three of these examples, exception processing is used to handle errors and ensure that the program behaves correctly even when something unexpected happens."

    "### Q2. What happens if you don&#39;t do something extra to treat an exception?\n",
    "In Python, if an exception is not handled by the program, it results in an error message and program termination. This error message is known as a traceback, which shows the error message, the line of code that caused the error, and the function or module where the error occurred.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of what happens if an exception is not handled:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def divide(x, y):\n",
    "    return x / y\n",
    "\n",
    "print(divide(10, 0))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "Traceback (most recent call last):\n",
    "  File \"example.py\", line 4, in <module>\n",
    "    print(divide(10, 0))\n",
    "  File \"example.py\", line 2, in divide\n",
    "    return x / y\n",
    "ZeroDivisionError: division by zero\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `divide()` function attempts to divide the first argument by the second argument. However, when the second argument is zero, a `ZeroDivisionError` exception is raised. Since we didn't handle this exception, Python prints a traceback message that shows the error occurred on line 2 of the file \"example.py\". The message indicates that a `ZeroDivisionError` occurred, which was caused by attempting to divide by zero."

    "### Q3. What are your options for recovering from an exception in your script?\n",
    "In Python, there are several options available for recovering from an exception in a script:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Handle the exception using a `try-except` block and recover from it:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    # Some code that may raise an exception\n",
    "except SomeException:\n",
    "    # Exception handling code here\n",
    "    # Recover from the exception if possible\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this case, if an exception is raised within the `try` block, the exception is caught by the corresponding `except` block, which then executes the exception handling code. After the exception is handled, the program continues execution at the statement immediately following the `try-except` block.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Handle the exception using a `try-except-else` block and recover from it:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    # Some code that may raise an exception\n",
    "except SomeException:\n",
    "    # Exception handling code here\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    # Code to run if no exception is raised\n",
    "    # Recover from the exception if possible\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this case, the `else` block is executed only if no exception is raised within the `try` block. If an exception is raised, the `except` block is executed instead. If the exception is handled, the program continues execution at the statement immediately following the `try-except-else` block.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Handle the exception using a `try-except-finally` block and recover from it:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    # Some code that may raise an exception\n",
    "except SomeException:\n",
    "    # Exception handling code here\n",
    "finally:\n",
    "    # Code that runs whether or not an exception was raised\n",
    "    # Recover from the exception if possible\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this case, the `finally` block is always executed, whether or not an exception was raised within the `try` block. This can be useful for performing cleanup operations or releasing resources that were acquired before the `try` block was executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Raise a new exception to replace the original exception and recover from it:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    # Some code that may raise an exception\n",
    "except SomeException as e:\n",
    "    # Exception handling code here\n",
    "    # Raise a new exception to replace the original exception\n",
    "    raise NewException(\"Error occurred: {}\".format(str(e)))\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this case, the `except` block catches the original exception, performs exception handling code, and raises a new exception to replace the original exception. The program then continues execution at the corresponding `except` block for the new exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are some of the options available in Python for recovering from an exception in a script. The choice of which to use depends on the specific situation and the desired behavior."

    "### Q4. Describe two methods for triggering exceptions in your script.\n",
    "There are several ways to trigger exceptions in Python. Here are two common methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Using the raise statement: The `raise` statement allows you to manually trigger an exception in your code. You can either raise a built-in exception class or create your own custom exception by subclassing `Exception`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example of raising a built-in exception\n",
    "x = -5\n",
    "if x < 0:\n",
    "    raise ValueError(\"x cannot be negative\")\n",
    "    \n",
    "# Example of defining and raising a custom exception\n",
    "class MyException(Exception):\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "\n",
    "def my_function():\n",
    "    # ... some code ...\n",
    "    raise MyException(\"Something went wrong\")\n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    my_function()\n",
    "except MyException as e:\n",
    "    print(\"Caught exception:\", e)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Using the assert statement: The `assert` statement allows you to check if a condition is True and raises an `AssertionError` if the condition is False.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 10\n",
    "y = 5\n",
    "assert y != 0, \"Cannot divide by zero\"\n",
    "result = x / y\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example above, if `y` was 0, the `assert` statement would raise an `AssertionError` and the program would terminate."

    "### Q5. Identify two methods for specifying actions to be executed at termination time, regardless of whether or not an exception exists.\n",
    "In Python, we can use the `finally` block and `atexit` module to specify actions to be executed at termination time, regardless of whether or not an exception exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `finally` block: This block of code is executed after the `try` block and any associated `except` blocks are executed, regardless of whether an exception was raised or not. It is used to define cleanup actions that must be executed under all circumstances. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    # some code that may raise an exception\n",
    "except SomeException:\n",
    "    # handle the exception\n",
    "finally:\n",
    "    # cleanup code that must be executed under all circumstances\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `atexit` module: This module provides a simple interface to register functions to be called when a program is closing down. This is useful when you need to ensure that certain actions are taken, regardless of how the program is terminated. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import atexit\n",
    "\n",
    "def goodbye():\n",
    "    print(\"Goodbye, world!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "atexit.register(goodbye)\n",
    "\n",
    "# some code that may raise an exception\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `goodbye()` function will always be called when the program is closing down, regardless of whether or not an exception was raised."

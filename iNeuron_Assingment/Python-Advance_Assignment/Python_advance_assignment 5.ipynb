    "### Q1. What is the meaning of multiple inheritance?\n",
    "Multiple inheritance is a feature in object-oriented programming languages like Python that allows a class to inherit from more than one parent class. In other words, a subclass can have multiple superclasses, and it inherits attributes and methods from all of them. This enables the subclass to combine the features of multiple classes, making it more versatile and capable of performing complex tasks."

    "### Q2. What is the concept of delegation?\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, delegation is a programming concept in which an object forwards some of its responsibilities to another object. This is done by creating a new object that holds a reference to the other object and delegates some tasks to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of delegation in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Square:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, side):\n",
    "        self.side = side\n",
    "\n",
    "    def area(self):\n",
    "        return self.side ** 2\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "class Cube:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, side):\n",
    "        self.square = Square(side)\n",
    "\n",
    "    def surface_area(self):\n",
    "        return self.square.area() * 6\n",
    "\n",
    "    def volume(self):\n",
    "        return self.square.area() * self.side\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we have two classes: `Square` and `Cube`. The `Square` class defines a `side` attribute and an `area()` method that returns the area of the square.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Cube` class, on the other hand, has a `surface_area()` method and a `volume()` method. Both of these methods rely on the `area()` method of the `Square` class. Instead of duplicating the `area()` method in the `Cube` class, we create an instance of the `Square` class inside the `Cube` class and delegate the `area()` method to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "By doing this, we reduce code duplication and improve code organization. We can also change the behavior of the `Square` class without affecting the `Cube` class, and vice versa. This is an example of the \"composition over inheritance\" principle, which is a common design pattern in object-oriented programming."

    "### Q3. What is the concept of composition?\n",
    "In object-oriented programming, composition refers to the process of combining two or more classes to form a more complex one. It involves creating an object that contains other objects that define its properties and behavior. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's say we want to create a `Car` class. We could compose this class using two other classes, `Engine` and `Transmission`. The `Engine` class would define the properties and behavior of the car's engine, such as horsepower and fuel efficiency. The `Transmission` class would define the properties and behavior of the car's transmission, such as the number of gears and the type of transmission (automatic or manual).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example implementation of the `Car` class using composition in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Engine:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, horsepower, fuel_efficiency):\n",
    "        self.horsepower = horsepower\n",
    "        self.fuel_efficiency = fuel_efficiency\n",
    "\n",
    "class Transmission:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, num_gears, transmission_type):\n",
    "        self.num_gears = num_gears\n",
    "        self.transmission_type = transmission_type\n",
    "\n",
    "class Car:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, engine, transmission):\n",
    "        self.engine = engine\n",
    "        self.transmission = transmission\n",
    "        \n",
    "    def drive(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Driving the car!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we have defined the `Engine` and `Transmission` classes, which represent the car's engine and transmission respectively. The `Car` class is then defined using these two classes. It takes an instance of the `Engine` and `Transmission` classes as arguments to its constructor, which are then assigned to instance variables `engine` and `transmission`. The `drive()` method simply prints a message to indicate that the car is being driven.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can create an instance of the `Car` class as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "engine = Engine(200, 30)\n",
    "transmission = Transmission(6, \"automatic\")\n",
    "car = Car(engine, transmission)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, we create instances of the `Engine` and `Transmission` classes, and then pass them to the `Car` constructor to create a new instance of the `Car` class. This instance of the `Car` class now contains instances of the `Engine` and `Transmission` classes, which define its properties and behavior."

    "### Q4. What are bound methodsÂ and how do we use them?\n",
    "In Python, a bound method is a method that is attached to an instance of a class and is able to access and modify the instance's attributes. Bound methods are created automatically when a method is called on an instance of a class, and the instance is passed as the first argument (self).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example to demonstrate the concept of bound methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Car:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, make, model):\n",
    "        self.make = make\n",
    "        self.model = model\n",
    "        self.mileage = 0\n",
    "        \n",
    "    def drive(self, miles):\n",
    "        self.mileage += miles\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def display_mileage(self):\n",
    "        print(f\"The {self.make} {self.model} has {self.mileage} miles on it.\")\n",
    "        \n",
    "# Create an instance of the Car class\n",
    "my_car = Car(\"Toyota\", \"Camry\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Call the drive() method on the instance\n",
    "my_car.drive(100)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Call the display_mileage() method on the instance\n",
    "my_car.display_mileage()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we define a `Car` class with an `__init__` method to initialize the `make`, `model`, and `mileage` attributes of a car instance. We also define two other methods: `drive` and `display_mileage`.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we create an instance of the `Car` class with `my_car = Car(\"Toyota\", \"Camry\")`, a new instance is created and assigned to the variable `my_car`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then call the `drive` method on `my_car` with `my_car.drive(100)`. This increases the `mileage` attribute of `my_car` by 100.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we call the `display_mileage` method on `my_car` with `my_car.display_mileage()`. This prints out the current `mileage` of `my_car`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, `drive` and `display_mileage` are bound methods because they are called on an instance of the `Car` class and have access to the instance's attributes, such as `mileage`."

    "### Q5. What is the purpose of pseudoprivate attributes?\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, pseudoprivate attributes are instance variables that have double underscore prefix (`__`) but do not have double underscore suffix. These attributes are also known as name mangling because Python interpreter changes their names to avoid naming conflicts with subclasses. The purpose of pseudoprivate attributes is to avoid accidental overwriting of instance variables in subclasses that might have the same name.\n",

    "\n",
    "The `SavingsAccount` class also has a `show_account_details()` method that calls the `__print_account_details()` method of the `BankAccount` class. Since `__print_account_details()` is a pseudoprivate method, it cannot be accessed directly from the `SavingsAccount` class, so it raises an AttributeError."

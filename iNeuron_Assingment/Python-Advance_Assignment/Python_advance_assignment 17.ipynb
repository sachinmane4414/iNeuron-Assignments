    "### Q1. Explain the difference between greedy and non-greedy syntax with visual terms in as few words as possible. What is the bare minimum effort required to transform a greedy pattern into a non-greedy one? What characters or characters can you introduce or change?\n",
    "\n",
    "In regular expressions, greedy syntax matches as much as possible, while non-greedy syntax matches as little as possible. \n",
    "\n",
    "To transform a greedy pattern into a non-greedy one, you can introduce the `?` character after the quantifier. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider the regular expression `.*`, which matches any character, repeated zero or more times, as much as possible (i.e., greedy). To make it non-greedy, you can add a `?` after the `*`, like so: `.*?`. This will match any character, repeated zero or more times, as little as possible (i.e., non-greedy).\n",

    "Here's an example in Python:\n",

    "\n",
    "In the first example, the `f.*o` pattern matches as much as possible, resulting in the entire string `\"foo bar\"`. In the second example, the `f.*?o` pattern matches as little as possible, resulting in just the `\"foo\"` substring.\n"

    "### Q2. When exactly does greedy versus non-greedy make a difference?Â  What if you&#39;re looking for a non-greedy match but the only one available is greedy?\n",
    "\n",
    "Greedy and non-greedy matching are two ways of matching patterns in regular expressions. \n",
    "\n",
    "In greedy matching, the pattern tries to match the longest possible sequence of characters that satisfies the pattern. On the other hand, non-greedy (or lazy) matching tries to match the shortest possible sequence of characters that satisfies the pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "Greedy matching is the default behavior of regular expressions, and it can be changed to non-greedy matching by adding a question mark `?` to the quantifier. For example, `.*?` is a non-greedy version of `.*`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice between greedy and non-greedy matching can make a difference when there are overlapping matches in the text being searched. For example, consider the text `\"ababab\"`. If we search for the pattern `a.*b` with greedy matching, it will match the entire string `\"ababab\"`. However, if we use non-greedy matching by adding a `?` to the quantifier, the pattern will match only `\"ab\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we are looking for a non-greedy match but the only available match is greedy, we can add a negative character set to the pattern to exclude the characters that we don't want to match. For example, if we want to match the first occurrence of `\"ab\"` in the text `\"ababab\"`, we can use the pattern `a[^a]*?b`, which will match `\"ab\"` but not `\"abab\"` or `\"ababab\"`."

    "### Q3. In a simple match of a string, which looks only for one match and does not do any replacement, is the use of a nontagged group likely to make any practical difference?\n",
    "\n",
    "In a simple match of a string, which looks only for one match and does not do any replacement, the use of a non-tagged group may not make any practical difference, but it depends on how the regular expression is written.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-tagged groups are used to group parts of a regular expression together without capturing them. They are denoted by parentheses with no group name or number. In a simple match, non-tagged groups may not affect the results because they do not affect the matching itself. However, they can still affect the performance of the regular expression, especially in more complex cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of a simple match using a non-tagged group:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import re\n",
    "\n",
    "text = \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\"\n",

    "match = re.search(pattern, text)\n",
    "print(match.group())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the non-tagged group `(quick)` is used to match the word \"quick\" in the text. However, since there is only one match, using a non-tagged group here does not make any practical difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, in more complex regular expressions with multiple matches, non-tagged groups can be used to improve performance by reducing the number of captured groups. This can make a significant difference in the speed of the regular expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are looking for a non-greedy match but the only one available is greedy, you can use the non-greedy modifier `?` to make the quantifier lazy. For example, the regular expression `.*?` will match as few characters as possible, while the regular expression `.*` will match as many characters as possible."

    "### Q4. Describe a scenario in which using a nontagged category would have a significant impact on the program&#39;s outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In regular expressions, a nontagged category, also known as a non-capturing group, is a group that is used for matching a pattern but is not captured as a group. It can be helpful in certain scenarios where grouping is necessary for matching, but the captured group is not required for further processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "One scenario where using a nontagged category can have a significant impact on the program's outcomes is when performing complex string manipulations, such as URL rewriting. In such cases, a group of characters may need to be matched, but only a portion of the group is required for further processing. In this case, using a nontagged category can prevent unnecessary capturing of the entire group, reducing the amount of data that needs to be processed and improving the performance of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider the following regular expression that matches a URL and captures the query string parameter \"id\":\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import re\n",
    "\n",
    "url = 'https://example.com/page?id=12345'\n",

    "    id = match.group(1)\n",
    "    print(id)\n",
    "```\n",

    "match = re.search(r'https://example\\.com/page\\?id=(?:\\d+)', url)\n",

    "    print(id)\n",

    "A look-ahead assertion is a zero-width assertion, which means it does not consume any characters in the string. It matches a specific pattern only if it is followed by another pattern.

    "\n",
    "For example, consider a string of email addresses, and you want to match all email addresses except those with a specific domain. In this case, you can use a negative look-ahead assertion to match all email addresses that are not followed by the specific domain. Here's an example:\n",

The match will only succeed if the sub-pattern is not found. Like positive look-ahead, the characters that matched the sub-pattern are not captured as part of the overall match.\n",

    "Referring to groups by name instead of number in a standard expression has several benefits:\n",

    "1. Clarity: Naming groups makes the regular expression more readable and easier to understand, especially for people who are not familiar with the pattern.\n",

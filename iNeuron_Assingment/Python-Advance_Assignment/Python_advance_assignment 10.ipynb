    "### Q1. What is the difference between __getattr__ and __getattribute__?\n",
    "In Python, both `__getattr__` and `__getattribute__` are special methods that are used to define how attribute access is handled in a class. The main difference between the two methods is in how they are called and what they return.\n",
    "\n",
    "`__getattr__` is called when an attribute is not found via the usual method of looking it up in the instance dictionary or the class hierarchy. It takes a single argument, the name of the attribute being accessed, and it should return the value of the attribute or raise an `AttributeError` if the attribute is not found.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example that demonstrates the use of `__getattr__`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class MyClass:\n",
    "    def __init__(self):\n",
    "        self.x = 10\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def __getattr__(self, name):\n",
    "        if name == 'y':\n",
    "            return 20\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            raise AttributeError(f\"'MyClass' object has no attribute '{name}'\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, `MyClass` has an attribute `x` that is set to 10 in the constructor. If we try to access an attribute `y` that does not exist, `__getattr__` is called and it returns the value 20. If we try to access any other attribute that does not exist, an `AttributeError` is raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, `__getattribute__` is called for every attribute access, regardless of whether the attribute exists or not. It takes a single argument, the name of the attribute being accessed, and it should return the value of the attribute or raise an `AttributeError` if the attribute is not found.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example that demonstrates the use of `__getattribute__`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class MyClass:\n",
    "    def __init__(self):\n",
    "        self.x = 10\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def __getattribute__(self, name):\n",
    "        if name == 'y':\n",
    "            return 20\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            return super().__getattribute__(name)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, `MyClass` has an attribute `x` that is set to 10 in the constructor. If we try to access an attribute `y`, `__getattribute__` is called and it returns the value 20. If we try to access any other attribute, `super().__getattribute__(name)` is called to look up the attribute in the usual way.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key difference between `__getattr__` and `__getattribute__` is that `__getattr__` is only called when an attribute is not found, while `__getattribute__` is called for every attribute access. As a result, `__getattribute__` can be more powerful but also more dangerous, as it can potentially cause infinite recursion if not implemented carefully."

    "### Q2. What is the difference between properties and descriptors?\n",
    "In Python, both properties and descriptors are used to manage attributes in classes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Properties are a simple way to add a computed attribute to a class. They allow you to define a method that behaves like an attribute. When the attribute is accessed, the method is called, and its return value is returned to the caller. Properties are defined using the `@property` decorator.\n",
    "\n",
    "Descriptors are more general than properties. They are classes that define the methods `__get__()`, `__set__()`, and/or `__delete__()`. These methods are called when an attribute is accessed, assigned, or deleted, respectively. Descriptors can be used to implement computed attributes, validate input values, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between properties and descriptors is that properties are defined at the class level, while descriptors are defined as separate classes that are assigned to attributes of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example that demonstrates the difference:\n",

    "\n",

    "print(t.fahrenheit.temperature)  # Output: 100.0\n",
    "``` \n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, `Celsius` and `Fahrenheit` are both properties. `Celsius` uses the `@property` decorator to define a computed attribute, and `Fahrenheit` uses the descriptor protocol to define a computed attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Temperature` is a class that has both `Celsius` and `Fahrenheit` attributes. `Celsius` is an instance of the `Celsius` class, which is a property, and `Fahrenheit` is an instance of the `Fahrenheit` class, which is a descriptor.\n",

    "\n",
    "When we set `t.fahrenheit.temperature`, the `__set__()` method of the `Fahrenheit` descriptor is called, which in turn sets the `temperature` attribute of the `Celsius` property. This causes the `__get__()` method of the `Fahrenheit` descriptor to be called again, and its return value is printed."

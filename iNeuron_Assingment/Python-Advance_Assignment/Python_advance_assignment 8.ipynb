    "### Q1. What are the two latest user-defined exception constraints in Python 3.X?\n",
    "In Python 3.x, the two latest user-defined exception constraints are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Custom Exception Class must inherit from the built-in `Exception` class or its subclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Custom Exception Class should provide meaningful message string either during initialization or as a property using `args`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example demonstrating these constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class NegativeNumberError(Exception):\n",
    "    \"\"\"Raised when a negative number is encountered.\"\"\"\n",
    "    def __init__(self, number):\n",
    "        self.number = number\n",
    "        self.message = f\"Negative numbers not allowed: {number}\"\n",
    "        super().__init__(self.message)\n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    num = -10\n",
    "    if num < 0:\n",
    "        raise NegativeNumberError(num)\n",
    "except NegativeNumberError as e:\n",
    "    print(e.message)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above example, we have created a custom exception class called `NegativeNumberError` that inherits from the built-in `Exception` class. We have also provided a meaningful message string during the initialization of the exception object using `args`. \n",
    "\n",
    "We then try to raise this exception when we encounter a negative number. The `try-except` block catches the `NegativeNumberError` exception and prints the message associated with it."

    "### Q2. How are class-based exceptions that have been raised matched to handlers?\n",
    "In Python, when an exception is raised, it is propagated up the call stack until it is handled by a suitable exception handler. If a matching handler is not found, the program will terminate with an error message.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a class-based exception is raised, Python checks if the exception class is derived from any of the exception classes mentioned in the except clause of a try-except block. If there is a match, the handler associated with the first matching except clause is executed. If there is no match, the exception is propagated up the call stack until a suitable handler is found, or the program terminates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class MyException(Exception):\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    raise MyException(\"This is a custom exception.\")\n",
    "except MyException as e:\n",
    "    print(\"Caught custom exception:\", e)\n",
    "except Exception as e:\n",
    "    print(\"Caught generic exception:\", e)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we define a custom exception called `MyException` by inheriting from the base `Exception` class. We then use a `try` statement to catch the exception and handle it accordingly. The `except MyException` clause matches the raised exception, so its associated block is executed, printing the message \"Caught custom exception: This is a custom exception.\". If the `except MyException` clause were not present, the `except Exception` clause would match the exception and its associated block would be executed.\n"

    "### Q3. Describe two methods for attaching context information to exception artefacts.\n",
    "In Python, we can attach context information to exception artefacts by using the following two methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Using the `raise ... from` statement: \n",
    "\n",
    "The `raise ... from` statement is used to attach a secondary exception that caused the primary exception to be raised. This secondary exception is stored as the `__cause__` attribute of the primary exception. This is useful when an exception occurs inside another exception, and you want to provide more context about what caused the original exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    f = open('nonexistent.txt')\n",
    "except FileNotFoundError as e:\n",
    "    raise ValueError('Invalid filename') from e\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, if the `open()` function raises a `FileNotFoundError`, we catch that exception and then raise a `ValueError` with the message 'Invalid filename', attaching the `FileNotFoundError` as the `__cause__` attribute of the `ValueError`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Using custom exception classes:\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also attach context information to exception artefacts by creating custom exception classes that store additional information about the error. These custom exceptions can have instance variables that store any additional information that we want to include in the error message.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class CustomError(Exception):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, message, context):\n",
    "        super().__init__(message)\n",
    "        self.context = context\n",
    "        \n",
    "try:\n",
    "    a = 5\n",
    "    b = 'test'\n",
    "    if type(b) is not int:\n",
    "        raise CustomError('Invalid type', {'a': a, 'b': b})\n",
    "except CustomError as e:\n",
    "    print(f\"Error: {e}, Context: {e.context}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we define a custom exception class `CustomError` that takes a message and a context dictionary as arguments. When we raise this exception, we pass in a message and a dictionary containing additional information about the error. We can then catch this exception and access the context information stored in the exception instance's `context` variable."

    "### Q4. Describe two methods for specifying the text of an exception object&#39;s error message.\n",
    "In Python, there are different ways to specify the text of an exception object's error message. Here are two methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Passing a message string to the exception constructor:\n",
    "   We can pass a message string to the exception constructor at the time of raising the exception to specify the error message. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   # Defining a custom exception\n",
    "   class MyError(Exception):\n",
    "       pass\n",
    "\n",
    "   # Raising the custom exception with an error message\n",
    "   raise MyError(\"An error occurred while processing the data\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Defining the `__str__` method in the exception class:\n",
    "   We can also define the `__str__` method in the custom exception class to specify the error message. This method should return the message string that we want to display when the exception is raised. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   # Defining a custom exception with a custom error message\n",
    "   class MyError(Exception):\n",
    "       def __str__(self):\n",
    "           return \"An error occurred while processing the data\"\n",
    "\n",
    "   # Raising the custom exception\n",
    "   raise MyError()\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "In both cases, when the exception is raised, the error message specified will be displayed along with the exception type."

    "### Q5. Why do you no longer use string-based exceptions?\n",
    "In older versions of Python, it was possible to raise exceptions by passing a string to the `raise` statement. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "raise \"This is an error message\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this approach is no longer recommended and is deprecated in Python 3. Instead, exceptions should be raised as instances of exception classes. This is because it is more powerful and flexible to have your own exception hierarchy defined by classes, rather than using string literals as the exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of how to create and raise a custom exception class instead of using string-based exceptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class CustomException(Exception):\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "\n",
    "raise CustomException(\"This is an error message\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach allows you to define your own exception hierarchy and add custom attributes to the exception objects. It also allows for more descriptive and meaningful error messages, as well as easier handling of exceptions in your code."

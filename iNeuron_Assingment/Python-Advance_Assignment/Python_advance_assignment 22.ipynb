    "### Q3. Describe the main differences between the array and numpy packages. \n",
    "\n",
    "The array and numpy packages in Python both provide support for working with arrays. However, there are some main differences between them:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data types: The array package supports only a limited set of data types, while numpy supports a much wider range of data types. For example, the array package supports only int, float, and complex data types, while numpy supports many more, including bool, string, and datetime.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Functionality: Numpy provides a much wider range of functionality than the array package. For example, numpy provides support for advanced mathematical operations like linear algebra and Fourier transforms, while the array package does not.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Performance: Numpy is optimized for performance and can handle large arrays much more efficiently than the array package. Numpy uses contiguous blocks of memory and can take advantage of vectorized operations, which can significantly speed up computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some examples to illustrate the differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data types:\n",
    "\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we create an array of integers using the array package and an array of floats using numpy.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Functionality:\n",

    "\n",
    "# Calculate the dot product of two arrays using numpy\n",

    "In this example, we calculate the dot product of two arrays using numpy and the array package. Numpy provides a built-in function for this operation, while with the array package we need to write our own code.\n",

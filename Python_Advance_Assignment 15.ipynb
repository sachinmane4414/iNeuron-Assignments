    "### 1. What are the new features added in Python 3.8 version?\n",
    "Python 3.8, which was released in October 2019, introduced several new features and improvements. Some of the key new features include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Assignment expressions (also known as the walrus operator): This feature allows for the assignment of a value to a variable within an expression, such as in a while loop or an if statement. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "while (n := get_next_value()) != -1:\n",
    "    print(n)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Positional-only parameters: This feature allows a function to specify which parameters can be passed positionally (without a keyword argument) and which cannot. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def my_func(a, b, /, c, d, *, e, f):\n",
    "    print(a, b, c, d, e, f)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, `a` and `b` can be passed positionally, but `c`, `d`, `e`, and `f` must be passed using keyword arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. f-strings now support the `=` specifier for debugging purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "name = 'John'\n",
    "age = 30\n",
    "print(f'{name=} {age=}')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will output `name='John' age=30`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. New modules and improvements to existing modules: Python 3.8 introduced several new modules, including `importlib.metadata` for accessing distribution metadata and `typing_extensions` for type hints. Additionally, existing modules such as `math` and `json` received updates and improvements.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are just a few of the new features and improvements in Python 3.8."

    "### 2. What is monkey patching in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Monkey patching in Python refers to the practice of modifying or extending the behaviour of a module or class at runtime by redefining its attributes or methods. It is a way of changing the behaviour of a piece of code without modifying its source code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of monkey patching in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# original module\n",
    "class MyClass:\n",
    "    def say_hello(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Hello, World!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# monkey patching\n",
    "def say_goodbye(self):\n",
    "    print(\"Goodbye, World!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "MyClass.say_hello = say_goodbye\n",
    "\n",
    "# usage\n",
    "obj = MyClass()\n",
    "obj.say_hello() # outputs \"Goodbye, World!\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we have defined a class `MyClass` with a method `say_hello()` that prints \"Hello, World!\" to the console. We then define a function `say_goodbye()` that prints \"Goodbye, World!\" to the console.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then use monkey patching to replace the `say_hello()` method of the `MyClass` with `say_goodbye()`. Now, when we create an instance of `MyClass` and call `say_hello()`, it will print \"Goodbye, World!\" instead of \"Hello, World!\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Monkey patching can be a powerful technique, but it should be used with caution. It can make code harder to understand and maintain, especially when multiple developers are working on the same codebase."

    "### 3. What is the difference between a shallow copy and deep copy?\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, when you want to create a copy of a list or dictionary, you have two options: shallow copy and deep copy. The main difference between them is how they copy the original object and their mutability.\n",
    "\n",
    "A shallow copy creates a new object, but instead of copying the elements themselves, it simply copies the references to the original elements. This means that changes to the original elements will also be reflected in the shallow copy.\n",
    "\n",
    "A deep copy, on the other hand, creates a completely new object with new references to the original elements, recursively. This means that any changes made to the original elements will not be reflected in the deep copy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some examples to illustrate the difference:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Shallow copy example\n",
    "original_list = [1, 2, [3, 4]]\n",
    "shallow_copy = original_list.copy()\n",
    "\n",
    "# The two lists have different identities\n",
    "print(original_list is shallow_copy)  # False\n",
    "\n",
    "# The sub-list is still the same object in both lists\n",
    "print(original_list[2] is shallow_copy[2])  # True\n",
    "\n",
    "# Modifying the sub-list in the original affects the shallow copy\n",
    "original_list[2].append(5)\n",
    "print(original_list)  # [1, 2, [3, 4, 5]]\n",
    "print(shallow_copy)  # [1, 2, [3, 4, 5]]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Deep copy example\n",
    "import copy\n",
    "\n",
    "original_list = [1, 2, [3, 4]]\n",
    "deep_copy = copy.deepcopy(original_list)\n",
    "\n",
    "# The two lists have different identities\n",
    "print(original_list is deep_copy)  # False\n",
    "\n",
    "# The sub-list is a new object in the deep copy\n",
    "print(original_list[2] is deep_copy[2])  # False\n",
    "\n",
    "# Modifying the sub-list in the original does not affect the deep copy\n",
    "original_list[2].append(5)\n",
    "print(original_list)  # [1, 2, [3, 4, 5]]\n",
    "print(deep_copy)  # [1, 2, [3, 4]]\n",
    "``` \n",
    "\n",
    "In the example of shallow copy, when the sub-list of the original list is modified, the same change is seen in the shallow copy. This is because both the original list and shallow copy have a reference to the same sub-list object.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example of deep copy, when the sub-list of the original list is modified, the deep copy is unaffected. This is because a new sub-list object was created for the deep copy."

    "### 4. What is the maximum possible length of an identifier?\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the maximum possible length of an identifier is not specified. However, according to the Python documentation, it is recommended to keep the identifier names reasonably short and to use only ASCII letters (a-z, A-Z), digits (0-9), and underscores (_). It is also suggested to start an identifier name with a letter or an underscore.\n",

    "### 5. What is generator comprehension?\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, generator comprehension is a concise way to create a generator object, which generates values on the fly as they are required, instead of constructing a list of all the values upfront. It is similar to list comprehension, but instead of using square brackets, we use parentheses.\n",
    "\n",
    "The syntax for generator comprehension is as follows:\n",
    "```\n",
    "(generator_expression for variable in iterable if condition)\n",
    "```\n",
    "where the generator expression is evaluated once for each value yielded by the generator, the variable takes each value from the iterable, and the condition is optional.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of using generator comprehension to generate a sequence of squared numbers from 1 to 10:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "sq_gen = (x**2 for x in range(1, 11))\n",
    "\n",
    "# prints the generator object\n",
    "print(sq_gen)  # <generator object <genexpr> at 0x000001>\n",
    "\n",
    "# prints the values generated by the generator object\n",
    "for num in sq_gen:\n",
    "    print(num, end=' ')  # 1 4 9 16 25 36 49 64 81 100\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this example, we first create a generator object `sq_gen` that yields the squared numbers from 1 to 10. We then print the generator object and iterate over it to print the squared numbers. Note that we only generate the values as we iterate over the generator, rather than generating all the values at once and storing them in a list."
